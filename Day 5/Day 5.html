Ali Hujwiri is believed to have contributed "significantly" to the spread of Islam in South Asia through his preaching,[6] with one historian describing him as "one of the most important figures to have spread Islam in the Indian subcontinent."[5] Khwaja Gharib Nawaz stayed at Ali Hujwiri's mausoleum and quoted a tribute to him as a narration; گنج بخش فیضِ عالَم مظہرِ نورِ خدا ناقصاں را پیرِ کامل ، کاملاں را راہنما Ganj Bakhsh-e-Faiz-e-Alam Mazhar-e-Nur-e-Khuda, Na Qasaan-ra Pir-i Kamil, Kamilaan-ra Rahnuma.[7]
